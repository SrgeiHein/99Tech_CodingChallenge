# 99Tech Coding Challenge

Three independent problems live inside this repository. Each problem folder contains its own README that dives deeper into implementation details, but the quick overview lives here.

## Problem 1 — Three Ways to Sum to *n*

- Folder: `./problem1`
- JavaScript helpers `sum_to_n_a/b/c` illustrate iterative, closed-form, and recursive strategies.
- Run `node problem1/sumToN.js` to see sample outputs.

## Problem 2 — Fancy Form

- Folder: `./problem2`
- A React + Vite single-page experience that mimics a polished swap interface.
- Fetches live token prices from `https://interview.switcheo.com/prices.json` and token icons from the Switcheo icon repo.
- Install dependencies and start the dev server:

  ```bash
  cd problem2
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

## Problem 3 — Messy React

- Folder: `./problem3`
- Contains a write-up (`solution.md`) detailing the inefficiencies/anti-patterns within the provided React snippet plus a hand-written refactor plan and sample code.

> 💡 Each folder is self-contained. Feel free to explore or run them independently depending on the problem statement you're evaluating.
